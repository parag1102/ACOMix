ACO-Mix: A novel Ant Colony Optimization

    1) Novel pheromone updating scheme.
    
    2) Involves exponential update in the initial iterations and inverse exponential in the
       later iterations, so that ants could be directed to better solutions by intensity of pheromone value.

    3) Benchmark Problems: Traveling Salesman Problem; 
       Benchmark Algorithm: Original ACO
       
    4) t-test and Alternative Hypothesis confirms that our ACO-mix is better than original ACO.
